# Twilio Food Notifications App

## Motivation
Due to the pandemic, the community, in particular hawker centers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre), at my home country has been affected. Unlike the U.S., hawker centers are more prevalent and they cannot operate like restaurants due to the close proximity between stores. I wanted to build a tool to help the hawker centers.

## Selling point
This app allows business owners to register an incoming call order, write down the order and notify the customers once the order is ready for pickup. This would reduce customers' wait time at the stalls and hence reducing the risk of being exposed to Covid.
